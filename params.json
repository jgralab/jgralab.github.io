We're the github arm of the [Research Group Software Technology](http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/campus-koblenz/fb4/ist/rgebert) at the [University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany](http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/).\r\n\r\n## JGraLab Projects\r\n\r\nHere's a list of our most important project's.  For a full list, visit our [organization page](https://github.com/jgralab).\r\n\r\n* [**JGraLab**](https://github.com/jgralab/jgralab): The Java Graph Laboratory itself, our high-performance Java graph library and modeling framework.  Includes the GReQL graph querying language and the GReTL graph transformation language.\r\n* [**FunnyQT**](https://github.com/jgralab/funnyqt): Our new model querying and transformation approach implemented as an API and embedded DSL in [Clojure](http://clojure.org).\r\n* [**EDL**](https://github.com/jgralab/edl): The Extractor Description Language, our parser generator especially targeted at generating extractors creating JGraLab graphs from textual artifacts.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
